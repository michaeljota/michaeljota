    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the second post in a series about comparing Typescript and Flow.</p><ul><li><a href="https://michaeljota.github.io/typescript-vs-flow-getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getting Started</a></li><li>IDE Support</li></ul><hr><p>In this post I will look for the most popular IDE and will look about how well they support and integrate with Typescript and Flow. I won’t be using any of this IDE, so this won’t include usability, that’s for another post. I’ll just check about how many IDE have support, and how many features for each, if the support is from a first party, or a third party. The order of appearance will be alphabetical. For the sake of web development, I will also add text editors.</p><h1 id="Atom"><a href="#Atom" class="headerlink" title="Atom"></a><a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atom</a></h1><blockquote><p>Atom is a free and open source popular text editor, created by Github using web technologies. It have plugins support, and many features available out the box.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Flow"><a href="#Flow" class="headerlink" title="Flow"></a>Flow</h2><p>Atom does not have support for Flow out-the-box. But it does have several plugins available for it.</p><h3 id="Nuclide"><a href="#Nuclide" class="headerlink" title="Nuclide"></a><a href="https://nuclide.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nuclide</a></h3><blockquote><p>Nuclide is a full IDE created by people at Facebook that has support for Flow built-in. It provides a linter, autocomplete and type coverage support, click-to-definition and type description on hover.<br>However, it currently <strong>lacks support for on-the-fly type-checking</strong> (showing your type errors before you save your file).</p></blockquote><h3 id="Flow-IDE"><a href="#Flow-IDE" class="headerlink" title="Flow-IDE"></a><a href="https://atom.io/packages/flow-ide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flow-IDE</a></h3><blockquote><p>Flow-IDE is a smaller package that only provides you with a linter and autocomplete functionality. It, too, currently lacks support for on-the-fly linting.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Linter-Flow"><a href="#Linter-Flow" class="headerlink" title="Linter-Flow"></a><a href="https://atom.io/packages/linter-flow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linter-Flow</a></h3><blockquote><p>In case you’re looking for something even more minimal, linter-flow may be worth your attention. It only lints your code and provides no other features, but it does support on-the-fly linting.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Autocomplete-Flow"><a href="#Autocomplete-Flow" class="headerlink" title="Autocomplete-Flow"></a><a href="https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-flow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autocomplete-Flow</a></h3><blockquote><p>autocomplete-flow is another purpose-built tool that only does one thing. This package, as the name suggests, will give your flow enabled code autocomplete suggestions and nothing else.</p></blockquote><hr><p>So there are four options, but it actually seems like we would combine at least three of them to have a real IDE experience. I think if I had to chose Atom, I could go with <code>Nuclide</code> and <code>Linter-Flow</code> and see how that works, but I use Windows to develop, just because, and <code>Nuclide</code> does not have full support for Windows. So, that.</p><h2 id="Typescript"><a href="#Typescript" class="headerlink" title="Typescript"></a>Typescript</h2><h3 id="Atom-Typescript"><a href="#Atom-Typescript" class="headerlink" title="Atom-Typescript"></a><a href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atom-Typescript</a></h3><blockquote><p>A Typescript language service for Atom developed by TypeStrong</p></blockquote><p>Well, we don’t have that much of options with Typescript, actually, there are a few where we will get that much of options. This depends on other package <code>atom-ide-ui</code>. On other hand, it have several common used features such as autocomplete, live error analysis, type description on hover, click-to-definition, and compile on save, among others. So, I think you will get all the IDE experience form this.</p><h1 id="Emacs"><a href="#Emacs" class="headerlink" title="Emacs"></a><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emacs</a></h1><blockquote><p>An extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor — and more.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Flow-1"><a href="#Flow-1" class="headerlink" title="Flow"></a>Flow</h2><h3 id="flow-for-emacs"><a href="#flow-for-emacs" class="headerlink" title="flow-for-emacs"></a><a href="https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-emacs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flow-for-emacs</a></h3><blockquote><p>An emacs plugin for Flow, a static typechecker for JavaScript.</p><ul><li>Shows errors found by typechecking JavaScript code with Flow.</li><li>Provides a bunch of common IDE features powered by Flow to aid reading and writing JavaScript code.</li></ul></blockquote><p>I haven’t used emacs, so I don’t know what to expect about this. I do know that you need to setup your environment to work with this. It is however, officially supported, so that is something.</p><h2 id="Typescript-1"><a href="#Typescript-1" class="headerlink" title="Typescript"></a>Typescript</h2><h3 id="tide-Typescript-Interactive-Development-Environment-for-Emacs"><a href="#tide-Typescript-Interactive-Development-Environment-for-Emacs" class="headerlink" title="tide - Typescript Interactive Development Environment for Emacs"></a><a href="https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tide</a> - Typescript Interactive Development Environment for Emacs</h3><p>I have the same problem with this. But it does seems to have more features available that the one for Flow. Maybe one of you guys can help me out with this.</p><h1 id="Sublime-Text"><a href="#Sublime-Text" class="headerlink" title="Sublime Text"></a><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sublime Text</a></h1><blockquote><p>A sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Flow-2"><a href="#Flow-2" class="headerlink" title="Flow"></a>Flow</h2><h3 id="Flow-3"><a href="#Flow-3" class="headerlink" title="Flow"></a><a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Flow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flow</a></h3><blockquote><p>Flow JavaScript analyzer plugin for SublimeText 2 and 3</p></blockquote><h3 id="SublimeLinter-flow"><a href="#SublimeLinter-flow" class="headerlink" title="SublimeLinter-flow"></a><a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-flow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SublimeLinter-flow</a></h3><blockquote><p>SublimeLinter plugin for JavaScript static type checking, using flow.</p></blockquote><hr><p>Again, we have options. The first actually has not been updated in over 3 years. It seems to runs only in Linux and MacOS, but it does have all the common features of Flow. The other one, have seen more recent releases, but it seems to be a Linter only plugin.</p><h2 id="Typescript-2"><a href="#Typescript-2" class="headerlink" title="Typescript"></a>Typescript</h2><h3 id="Typescript-Sublime-Plugin"><a href="#Typescript-Sublime-Plugin" class="headerlink" title="Typescript Sublime Plugin"></a><a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-Plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Typescript Sublime Plugin</a></h3><blockquote><p>The plugin uses an IO wrapper around the Typescript language services to provide an enhanced Sublime Text experience when working with Typescript code.</p></blockquote><p>This is an official plugin from Microsoft and it seems to have all common used features about Typescript. It is regularly updated and also have support for Linux, Windows and MacOS.</p><h1 id="Vim-and-NeoVim"><a href="#Vim-and-NeoVim" class="headerlink" title="Vim (and NeoVim)"></a><a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vim</a> (and <a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeoVim</a>)</h1><blockquote><p>Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Flow-4"><a href="#Flow-4" class="headerlink" title="Flow"></a>Flow</h2><h3 id="ale-Asynchronous-Lint-Engine-Vim-and-NeoVim"><a href="#ale-Asynchronous-Lint-Engine-Vim-and-NeoVim" class="headerlink" title="ale - Asynchronous Lint Engine (Vim and NeoVim)"></a><a href="https://github.com/w0rp/ale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ale</a> - Asynchronous Lint Engine (Vim and NeoVim)</h3><blockquote><p>The Asynchronous Lint Engine (ALE) vim-ale plugin for Vim 8+ and NeoVim provides linting of many syntaxes during editing, before files are saved.

Also, <code>ale</code> integrate with other common tools used to lint. <code>vim-flow</code> is the official tool, however, even in the <code>flow</code> IDE page is the second to chose, so. I think I would take the first one.</p><h2 id="Typescript-3"><a href="#Typescript-3" class="headerlink" title="Typescript"></a>Typescript</h2><h3 id="nvim-typescript-NeoVim-only"><a href="#nvim-typescript-NeoVim-only" class="headerlink" title="nvim-typescript (NeoVim only)"></a><a href="https://github.com/mhartington/nvim-typescript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nvim-typescript</a> (NeoVim only)</h3><blockquote><p>Provides standard IDE-like features such as auto-completion, viewing of documentation and type-signatures, go to definition, and reference finding.</p></blockquote><h3 id="typescript-vim-Vim-only"><a href="#typescript-vim-Vim-only" class="headerlink" title="typescript-vim (Vim only)"></a><a href="https://github.com/leafgarland/typescript-vim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typescript-vim</a> (Vim only)</h3><blockquote><p>Typescript Syntax for Vim.</p></blockquote><h3 id="yats-vim-Vim-only"><a href="#yats-vim-Vim-only" class="headerlink" title="yats.vim (Vim only)"></a><a href="https://github.com/HerringtonDarkholme/yats.vim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yats.vim</a> (Vim only)</h3><blockquote><p>Yet Another Typescript Syntax: The most advanced Typescript Syntax Highlighting in Vim</p></blockquote><h3 id="Tsuquyomi-Vim-only"><a href="#Tsuquyomi-Vim-only" class="headerlink" title="Tsuquyomi (Vim only)"></a><a href="https://github.com/Quramy/tsuquyomi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tsuquyomi</a> (Vim only)</h3><blockquote><p>Make your Vim a Typescript IDE.</p></blockquote><hr><p>You would probably have to chose one syntax highlighting, and combine it with Tsuquyomi. Tsuquyomi is a client for the TSServer, and will allow you to use completion, go-to-definition and other features to a IDE-like experience. It need for a buffer is saved to check the file. You can check manually with a command, and also it allows you to check the entire project with another command.</p><h1 id="Visual-Studio-Code"><a href="#Visual-Studio-Code" class="headerlink" title="Visual Studio Code"></a><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Studio Code</a></h1><blockquote><p>Code editing.

Flowtype is a static type checker went to find errors in Javascript programs.</p></blockquote><hr><p>The official plugin, Flow Language Support, seems to have all the features that you are looking in a plugin like this, such as Intellisense, go-to-definition, errors and warnings diagnostics, and others. The Flow IDE also seems to have all this features.</p><h2 id="Typescript-4"><a href="#Typescript-4" class="headerlink" title="Typescript"></a>Typescript</h2><p>Typescript support is build-in on VSCode.

However, you would need to configure Flow first to be able to use it, whereas to use Typescript, no previous configuration is required.</p><hr><h1 id="Additional-Supported-IDE"><a href="#Additional-Supported-IDE" class="headerlink" title="Additional Supported IDE"></a>Additional Supported IDE</h1><h2 id="Flow-6"><a href="#Flow-6" class="headerlink" title="Flow"></a>Flow</h2><p>Actually, according to the documentation, Flow support is limited to the IDE already listed.</p><h2 id="Typescript-5"><a href="#Typescript-5" class="headerlink" title="Typescript"></a>Typescript</h2><p>Typescript does have support for other IDE:</p><ul><li><a href="https://alm-tools.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alm.tools</a> - Complete IDE for Typescript.

I hope Flow support improve in the future with more plugins and IDE using this, because at the end they are implementing a long extended protocol, the Language Server Protocol. Today Windows does not seems to be a very supported platform to work with Flow, but they did release a Windows binary recently, so I think this can change.</p><blockquote><p>To develop with Flow better have a Unix like machine to use Nuclide.</p><p>To develop with Typescript even when you have more choices, you are safe with VSCode.</p><p><del>Either way you are stuck with Electron consuming your soul for living</del></p></blockquote><p>Even when you will probably have the same experience coding Flow with Nuclide, that coding Typescript with VSCode, the fact that you can’t even choice the SO bugs me. If you want to be outside the safe zone, you will have to install and configure Flow most of the time that you will need to configure Typescript. For this reason I will score Typescript with an 9, and Flow with a 6. You may see this unfair, but stick with me, the main issue is that you need a Linux machine or a Mac, to be able to run the editor with best Flow support, but if you don’t want one of the Microsoft editors, you probably will end with a really good experience.</p><h1 id="Current-Score"><a href="#Current-Score" class="headerlink" title="Current Score"></a>Current Score</h1><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th style="text-align:center">Typescript</th><th style="text-align:center">Flow</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Getting Started</td><td style="text-align:center">17</td><td style="text-align:center">16</td></tr><tr><td>Editor Support</td><td style="text-align:center">9</td><td style="text-align:center">6</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td style="text-align:center">26</td><td style="text-align:center">22</td></tr></tbody></table><h1 id="That’s-all-folks"><a href="#That’s-all-folks" class="headerlink" title="That’s all folks!"></a>That’s all folks!</h1><p>Thank you for reading.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>I won’t hide the fact that I’m a fulltime Typescript developer, but I will try hard to give Flow a chance, because I really want a fair comparison between them. I know there has been several over the years, but this one, I’ll try to update it at least twice per year.</p><p>I first met Typescript while working in my BD final project. Then, I have strong knowledge about Java and C#, but I didn’t quite knew Javascript, so Typescript was something that interested me instantly. Anyhow, back then, I think that precompilers and build tools was just too much for me, so I did not work with it until mid 2016, when Angular came out.</p><p>And I met Flow last year, while I was working in a React project. We wanted to add static type check to the project, because it was getting big, and we weren’t scaling that well. I try both of them back then, but I really wanted to use Typescript, because it have all this new syntax, so I did not give much credit to Flow.</p><p>I remember we, as team, chose Typescript, because its integration with several IDEs. I want to think things changed, and want to give Flow a chance, a real one this time.</p><p>I try to use a scale from 1 to 10 to evaluate the two of them in several features. At the end, I will just sum all the individual scores. However, I don’t think the final score would be an indication of witch one is better <del>of curse it will, if not why I’m even giving scores?</del>.</p><hr><h2 id="What-are-they"><a href="#What-are-they" class="headerlink" title="What are they?"></a>What are they?</h2><p>Flow is a static type checker for JavaScript, and Typescript is a language that strictly super sets JavaScript with optional static typing. This is a subtle difference between them, and I hope you notice it as we get down the road.</p><h2 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><h5 id="Flow"><a href="#Flow" class="headerlink" title="Flow"></a>Flow</h5><p>To start with Flow, we will need to install a compiler to remove the type annotations of the files. This will be either Babel, configured with Flow preset, or <code>flow-remove-types</code>. I will go with the first one, as I think most of the projects now days use Babel anyway.</p><ol><li>We initialize the project, and add Babel dev dependencies, and Flow preset.</li></ol><figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ ~/flow<span class="comment"># npm init -y</span></span><br><span class="line">$ ~/flow<span class="comment"># npm i -D babel-cli babel-preset-env babel-preset-flow</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><ol><li>Configure Babel and add a script in <code>package.json</code>.</li></ol><p><code>.babelrc</code></p><figure class="highlight json"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">"presets"</span>: [<span class="string">"env"</span>, <span class="string">"flow"</span>]</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><code>package.json</code> (excerpt)</p><figure class="highlight json"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">"scripts"</span>: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">"build"</span>: <span class="string">"babel src/ -d lib/"</span></span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><ol><li>Install and configure Flow</li></ol><figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ ~/flow<span class="comment"># npm i -D flow-bin</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><blockquote><p>If you have a recent version of <code>npm</code> (^5.3.0) you could use <code>npx</code>, as I will.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Organizing-your-ngrx-components-using-ducks"><a href="#Organizing-your-ngrx-components-using-ducks" class="headerlink" title="Organizing your ngrx components using ducks"></a>Organizing your ngrx components using ducks</h1><p>I started to use ngrx recently, again, but I couldn’t find a way to organize the code following the team recommendations. I noticed that most of the style guide was using a folder-by-type structure, popular amount React projects but discouraged by the Angular Style Guide, that strongly suggests the use of a folder-by-feature structure. They even divide the features of the application in core, shared, and other features, where most of the time, core module should be importing all the core components and services of the application and be loaded by the main module, shared module should use a barrel module for all the shared components and should be imported by the features modules, and they recommend to all others feature modules to be lazy loaded.</p><p>The community seems to have a strong opinion of when to use each structure, but most of the time, folder-by-feature is recommended, because it allows to scale easier than folder-by-type.</p><p>When I worked with Angular and ngrx, I used folder-by-type, and the projects I have worked with React, our team used folder-by-type, and we tried to implement the <a href="https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ducks</a> proposal often. There is a extension of that proposal to be used in a folder-by-fracture structure, named <a href="https://github.com/alexnm/re-ducks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re-ducks</a>. So, based off the re-ducks proposal, and using the Angular Style Guide, I develop a Tour of Hero app.</p><p>I documented the result in <a href="github.com/michaeljota/ngrx-ducks">ngrx-ducks</a> repository, and I will try to explain it here.</p><h3 id="Store"><a href="#Store" class="headerlink" title="Store"></a>Store</h3><p>In <code>@ngrx</code> the store have to be configured as a module, using a similar approach that Route Module have. So I took most of the recommendations about the routes in the ASG and applied to the Store in the project. </p><h3 id="Ducks"><a href="#Ducks" class="headerlink" title="Ducks"></a>Ducks</h3><p>Reducers, Actions, Effects, and Selectors, are called ducks in the proposal with the same name. In that proposal, it assumes that you are using a folder-by-type structure, and suggest to use a ducks file exporting all your ducks. In the re-ducks proposal however, it assumes that you are using a folder-by-feature structure, and suggest to separate each part of the ducks in its own file, and reexport them in a index file, inside a ducks folder.</p><p>In this proposal however, I assume that most of your reducers will be related with one component. Assuming that one reducer will handle the state of one component, allow you to put your ducks along with this.</p><p>To assume this, I also assume that you are using a folder-by-feature structure, and your are declaring a module for every of your features. This module should have its own store, and should import the state of the reducers and initialize the state of that feature. Also, it should export a feature selector, to be used by the each of that feature components selectors.</p><h1 id="A-word-about-this"><a href="#A-word-about-this" class="headerlink" title="A word about this"></a>A word about this</h1><p>Obviously, this is not an approach for everybody. If you fell like you can use the current style guide from <code>@ngrx</code>, that’s totally ok. I just need and alternative to use in larger projects. If you have a suggestion or anything, please, leave it in the comments, or better yet, open an issue in the repo.</p><p>The complete proposal is quite large to be included here, but you can read it in <a href="github.com/michaeljota/ngrx-ducks">ngrx-ducks</a>. </p><p>I know I did this thinking about me, but I really hope this can help someone else. </p><p>Thanks you so much for reading this, and I will really appreciate your thoughts about this. I don’t fell like having so much experience in large projects, but I do fell like thinking in horizontal scaling is a good approach to do so.  </p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>This week I’ve been playing around (again) with <code>@ngrx</code>, its store, effects, and go on, trying to integrating to a version of Tour of Heroes. It’s been more than a year since the last time I play with it, and I have to say, I’m becoming a more productive developer, and this has also evolve to become a better platform. The fact that observables now use piped operators, makes everything easier to understand.</p><p>I been watching some tutorials, and been reading a lot about the changes introduced with recent versions of the store, and I don’t know. I change the application state in two days. You may think that is a lot of time, but I didn’t know how to use effects, and also I wanted to follow the Angular Style Guide on this one, and the example app of <code>@ngrx</code> does not follow it, and most of the redux examples are made, well, for a React project.</p><p>I had my thoughts about the structure of an Angular application, but they were heavily influenced by the structure of React applications. The current Angular Code Style have change my mind about, but this is for another post.</p><h2 id="The-recommended-way"><a href="#The-recommended-way" class="headerlink" title="The recommended way"></a>The recommended way</h2><p>What I want to talk in this post, is about the recommended way to declare a state.</p><figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">export</span> <span class="keyword">interface</span> AppState &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    counter: <span class="built_in">number</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">export</span> <span class="keyword">const</span> initialAppState: AppState &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    counter: <span class="number">3</span>,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Why? Ok, here is why. It IS recommended that you use a POJO for declaring the state, and the actions. But, does it really hurt to declare an immutable Typescript class to declare the State?</p><h2 id="Classy"><a href="#Classy" class="headerlink" title="Classy"></a>Classy</h2><figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">export</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> AppState &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">public</span> readonly counter: <span class="built_in">number</span> = <span class="number">3</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>When this is set in the store configuration, the state initializes as a POJO as well, so there is no side effects going around here.</p><figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> &#123; StoreModule &#125; <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">'@ngrx/store'</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">export</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> AppState &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">public</span> readonly counter: <span class="built_in">number</span> = <span class="number">3</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> reducers = <span class="function">(<span class="params">state = <span class="keyword">new</span> AppState(<span class="params"></span>), action</span>) =&gt;</span> state; <span class="comment">// Best reducer ever!</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">@NgModule</span>(&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  imports: [</span><br><span class="line">    StoreModule.forRoot(reducers, &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      initialState: <span class="keyword">new</span> AppState(),</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;)</span><br><span class="line">  ]</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">export</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> AppStoreModule &#123;&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>I think this is clearer. You make sure that you set all the required properties, and only need to call the constructor when ever you need. And, you can use the AppState as a interface, wherever you want. </p><p>Do you think this is a good thing o a bad thing? Why? I would like to read your comments. </p>]]></content>

However, I will not simple say this should like that because I like it better, but will try to reason about behind that.</p><h1 id="The-web-development-is-the-future"><a href="#The-web-development-is-the-future" class="headerlink" title="The web development is the future"></a>The web development is the future</h1><p>With the introduction of Progressive Web Apps it is clear that the web applications should in the future replace the native applications. But, not quite at all. Technologies such NativeScript, ReactNative, ReactVR and a large renderers have teach us that the web development is not just about a browser, but instead this could be renderer by any kind of technologies.</p><p>Aside of that, the JavaScript language can now be used for Server side coding, and have also several others applications, that were just simple unimaginable when the language was created, robots and IoT, just to give an example.</p><p>This leads me to believe that web technologies will allow us to develop any kind of application in any kind of platforms, current or future.</p><h1 id="The-web-development-is-the-past"><a href="#The-web-development-is-the-past" class="headerlink" title="The web development is the past"></a>The web development is the past</h1><p>However, we need to change how we develop web applications. The languages that we use everyday have evolve for decades to become what they are today. But we should never forget how that languages were create and the reason why they were create. For example, Javascript was create in only 10 days, and just because they wanted to any developer could glue up some HTML.</p><p>Web languages was not created for any of the current applications, for that reason several other technologies and languages was create to allow a better development environment for the web, such Typescript, JSX and CSS-in-JS to name a few, but top used of that new technologies.</p><p>The browser itself haven’t change much over the years. Of curse, web languages have become standardized and browsers now implements features for that standardizations, and new standards have allow us to develop with new features, but at the end, we are developing with the same languages, and the same syntax, to be interpreted in the same way. We are developing for a 25 years old system, and we have to maintain it.</p><h1 id="The-web-development-needs-to-evolve"><a href="#The-web-development-needs-to-evolve" class="headerlink" title="The web development needs to evolve"></a>The web development needs to evolve</h1><p>I think that new web technologies need to be created, standardized and replace the current ones. We need to keep all the good things that we currently have, learn from the bad things, and apply the ones that the community have embrace over all these years.</p><h2 id="Markup-language"><a href="#Markup-language" class="headerlink" title="Markup language"></a>Markup language</h2><h5 id="The-bad-about-HTML"><a href="#The-bad-about-HTML" class="headerlink" title="The bad about HTML"></a>The bad about HTML</h5><p>There is essentially nothing bad with HTML, but we need to start noticing the importance of a good write program. HTML was create to write simple elements,<br>with a predictable syntax, and I don’t think we have that anymore. With libraries such Angular, React, and Vue, and future features as Web Components, we are no longer written simple elements, and by any reason we have a predictable syntax. We need to know the properties that the elements needs, and how they will be applied.</p><h5 id="The-good-about-HTML"><a href="#The-good-about-HTML" class="headerlink" title="The good about HTML"></a>The good about HTML</h5><p>HTML is a really simple to learn, and with that we could develop a skeleton application in seconds. The syntax is simple and play nice with other templates engines, such ejs, and other languages, such PHP.</p><h5 id="What-we-could-learn"><a href="#What-we-could-learn" class="headerlink" title="What we could learn"></a>What we could learn</h5><p>We need a simple way to define custom elements and isolated templates. The way Vue define templates is really simple. I also like the way Angular consume templates, even when a template could be potentially used by many components, most of the times an Angular template is used by a single complement. Also, this new language have to be used for templates engines, and other languages without much effort, and have to be simple and effective.</p><h5 id="What-I-think-should-be"><a href="#What-I-think-should-be" class="headerlink" title="What I think should be"></a>What I think should be</h5><p>HTML as is, is a great language. However, I think that this language have to evolve, and stop being a XML extension to become a complete language on its own, one that allows to grow, but also to keep backward compatibility with older implementations of the same language. Also, needs to have some template logic operations on its own, a syntax capable of be integrated with current and future languages, and maintain isolation.</p><p>I think a QML inspired language could be really good for the web. The tree structure that QML manages, resembles HTML, but its mean to be written for complex applications and to handle custom elements. It doesn’t have to be QML as is right now. For me, this is just an idea, but I think we really need a markup syntax made for current applications. One more thing that I would like to see in this language would be typed attributes, and a simple way to define them in new components.</p><h2 id="Style-language"><a href="#Style-language" class="headerlink" title="Style language"></a>Style language</h2><h5 id="The-bad-about-CSS"><a href="#The-bad-about-CSS" class="headerlink" title="The bad about CSS"></a>The bad about CSS</h5><p>As with HTML, there is nothing really wrong about CSS, it is a simple language to learn, but is really hard to master it. Also a couple things that needs to be improved. One is the need for a way to apply isolated style in custom components, and restyle that components easily as well. And if you are thinking <em>“Shadow DOM have that”</em>, yeah, it does. But Shadow DOM is still an experiment, and the specification is being developed, with several things being dropped, and replaced. Let’s face it, adding a new feature to CSS is too slow, and even when we have it, we need to wait until majority of browsers could support it, and prefix the properties with the vendor name for properties that are not standardized. </p><p>And that leave us with the second thing to be improved. The current way to bring new features to older browsers is to polyfill them. CSS is really hard to polyfill, and effectively unviable.</p><h5 id="The-good-about-CSS"><a href="#The-good-about-CSS" class="headerlink" title="The good about CSS"></a>The good about CSS</h5><p>Like HTML, CSS is a really simple language, that can accomplish complex thing.<br>As I said, is easy to learn, and most of editors have autocomplete capability. </p><h5 id="What-we-could-learn-1"><a href="#What-we-could-learn-1" class="headerlink" title="What we could learn"></a>What we could learn</h5><p>We could learn as much as SCSS let us to learn. I formerly thought that SCSS stands for Super CSS, I know, I know. I was just beginning in web development, but can you blame me? The syntax is identical to CSS, and it allows to nest selectors, apply mixins, use variables, and many other things. SCSS have become in many case the standard way of develop web styles.</p><h5 id="What-I-think-it-should-be"><a href="#What-I-think-it-should-be" class="headerlink" title="What I think it should be"></a>What I think it should be</h5><p>The new language for apply styles in complex applications should resemble CSS, with the features that SCSS allows us to have. What I’m saying is, the features that SCSS allow us to have should be standard. Needs support for better cross file references.</p><p>I think it needs some standardizations of the currently spec, including the initial value of the rules, and a standardized unit value, that would display nice in every device, and I not talking only about web consumer devices, but other renderer engines should display the same structure identical. In deep, it needs to be able to play nicely in older implementations of that language, and a simple way to polyfill when it need.</p><h2 id="Scripting-Language"><a href="#Scripting-Language" class="headerlink" title="Scripting Language"></a>Scripting Language</h2><h5 id="The-bad-about-Javascript"><a href="#The-bad-about-Javascript" class="headerlink" title="The bad about Javascript"></a>The bad about Javascript</h5><p>Javascript is broken. It was born broken, and it have been broken ever since. Nowadays, there are more, and more new features that are being added to the spec, but we are just putting some band-aid in a broken leg. That just won’t work. Even now, when Javascript engines interpret scripts almost the same way, there are several things that are just wrong with the language, and they are in its bones, you can’t just make Javascript work as a proper language anymore.</p><p>This, I believe, and no other, are the one thing that needs to be replaced. Javascript is a language that can now run in a multitude of device, in a large amount of platforms, and it is just broken. We don’t need to keep adding new features to Javascript, we need to write and standardize a new scripting language that could be used to develop complex application.</p><h5 id="The-good-about-Javascript"><a href="#The-good-about-Javascript" class="headerlink" title="The good about Javascript"></a>The good about Javascript</h5><p>Javascript is an incredible easy programming language to learn, and it’s also powerful. Every single thing in the web right have some amount of Javascript, and now, even mobile and desktop applications run Javascript. I think that’s amazing. You don’t need a complex structure application to start a Javascript program, you just need to write a function and then called it. The simplicity is just beautiful. Adding new features on older browsers with polyfills are easy and accurate, most of the time. </p><h5 id="What-we-could-learn-2"><a href="#What-we-could-learn-2" class="headerlink" title="What we could learn"></a>What we could learn</h5><p>Projects and languages as Typescript, Flow, Props, and several others, say to us, that even when we don’t want to, we need this to be a typed language. Large enterprise level applications need a predictable way to work with, and Javascript is just not predictable at all. </p><p>New features such spread operator, decorators, template strings, and others, have show us that a language needs to evolve from what it is to what the community wants.</p><p>Even libraries should be something we need to learn from, for example Immutable. That brings something something like immutability to Javascript, and have teach us why this is should be important. There is even a proposal to bring immutable feature to current Javascript. </p><p>But, what we need the most, is to learn about the Javascript weirdness and just make a proper language. We don’t need a triple equal operator, we need a equal operator that don’t do weird things underneath. </p><h5 id="What-I-think-it-should-be-like"><a href="#What-I-think-it-should-be-like" class="headerlink" title="What I think it should be like"></a>What I think it should be like</h5><p>No surprise here, I think Typescript needs to be effectively the Javascript superset that it says to be, or at least, something like it. Sure, currently Typescript compiles to plain old Javascript, some times even making ES7 features available to ES5 browsers, but what would be better if for the browser to properly understand what Typescript code actually mean. This would allow to take advantage about the type system that Typescript have, the better is that being a super set of Javascript, every program written in Javascript is a valid Typescript program.</p><p>Well, now that we are dreaming, we could deprecate keywords such <code>var</code>, and operators like <code>===</code> in favor of the new syntax <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>, and simple <code>==</code> without any casting. I would even say that <code>const</code> should be able to store a constant object and function, in which the assignment of new values for any of its properties, recursively would be impossible. <code>class</code>es would be classes for real, and could be written as any other class in other languages. <code>interfaces</code> would be a real thing that you could check in runtime. And several others features that would result in a better language.</p><p>The language would still the same function first language, with the nice syntax, optional typing, falling back to our dear <code>any</code> type when there is not assignment or type declaration. Well, if we still have any type, there should be a type transformation when dealing with equality, right? Not exactly. Even when the type is not specify, the variable still have a type when gets evaluated, that is somewhat the current behavior with triple check equality.</p><h2 id="The-Web-apps"><a href="#The-Web-apps" class="headerlink" title="The Web apps"></a>The Web apps</h2><h5 id="The-good-about-the-Web-apps"><a href="#The-good-about-the-Web-apps" class="headerlink" title="The good about the Web apps"></a>The good about the Web apps</h5><p>The web applications are not compile for an operative system, nor they run on top of a virtual machine, they are run inside of a browser. But they can be compile for an operative system, and the could run on top of a virtual environment, and they could be used to program servers, and robots, and any kind of things now.</p><p>What is really good about the web applications, there are just developed using standards. You may notice that I use that word a lot along the post, and the reason is because Web as we know it, is just a complex series of standards, that can be implemented in anyhow, by anyone, anywhere. To do so, you just need to properly implement the current specifications about the technologies you want to use, as best as you can, and you can even decide what to do in things that are not properly describe. I think that is beauty. I think that is the future.</p><h5 id="What-I-think-it-will-be-like"><a href="#What-I-think-it-will-be-like" class="headerlink" title="What I think it will be like"></a>What I think it will be like</h5><p>Maybe not in a year, maybe not in two. But sooner than latter, native web applications will be in our lives, they will behave like any other native application that we currently have, and will perform likewise. I’m not talking about Cordova, or NativeScript, but deep integration of web applications with the operative systems.</p><p>New operative systems that will only need to implement web technologies to be usable, and new web rendereres in devices we only dream now.</p><p>Applications will be develop like back in the days, when I didn’t actually code, with a language for a feature, without bundlers, transpilers, or anything that we currently have. Because we will learn from what we have, and evolve. </p><h1 id="That’s-all-folks"><a href="#That’s-all-folks" class="headerlink" title="That’s all folks"></a>That’s all folks</h1><p>If you really read all this, thanks you. It’s a really long post, and it’s very opinionated. I would like to read in your comments, how you imagine the applications development would be in a couple years.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Previously-on…"><a href="#Previously-on…" class="headerlink" title="Previously on…"></a>Previously on…</h1><p>In the previous sections and stories, I explained how to integrate an Angular-CLI generated application with Electron, and also how to write the same Electron application in Typescript. So far, this would allow a simple Angular application being packed as a Electron application, but there is no way for us to interact with Electron’s main thread.</p><ul><li><a href="/integrating-an-angular-cli-application-with-electron-the-seed">The seed</a></li><li><a href="/electron-with-typescript-using-ts-node">Electron with Typescript</a></li></ul><h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>In this post I’ll try to explain how to get a real integrating between Angular and Electron, and be able to communicate using Electron’s IPC.</p><h2 id="What-is-IPC"><a href="#What-is-IPC" class="headerlink" title="What is IPC?"></a>What is IPC?</h2><p>IPC is the inter-process communication module of Electron. With that you can send messages between your web application and the main thread application. To send and receive messages in the main thread you would have to use the <a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api/ipc-main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ipcMain</a> function property. Likewise, for the renderer process you would like to use the <a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api/ipc-renderer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ipcRenderer</a>.</p><h2 id="How-to-use-ipcMain"><a href="#How-to-use-ipcMain" class="headerlink" title="How to use ipcMain?"></a>How to use ipcMain?</h2><p>Use ipcMain is a simple as require it, and use one of the functions that are able for us.<br><figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> &#123; ipcMain &#125; <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">'electron'</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">ipcMain.on(<span class="string">'ping'</span>, <span class="function">(<span class="params">event</span>) =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    logger(<span class="string">'ping'</span>); <span class="comment">// Assume there is a logger function that would display 'ping' in console. console object does not work as-is, and it's not so easy to configure it.</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>With that, the application will be listening a <code>&#39;ping&#39;</code> event, and will print <code>ping</code> in the console. Easy peasy.</p><h2 id="How-to-normally-use-ipcRenderer"><a href="#How-to-normally-use-ipcRenderer" class="headerlink" title="How to (normally) use ipcRenderer?"></a>How to (normally) use ipcRenderer?</h2><p>In a normal scenario, a simple <code>require(&#39;electron&#39;).ipcRenderer</code> would give us access to the IPC in the renderer thread. So, following the previous example, we could do something like:</p><figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> &#123; ipcRenderer &#125; = <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'electron'</span>);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">ipcRenderer.send(<span class="string">'ping'</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This will invoke the callback function in the main thread. </p><p>But, this won’t work in the Angular-CLI application. Angular-CLI underneath uses Webpack, and thus the latter will find the <code>require</code> <em>key</em> word, interpret as a call for the Node.js’ <code>require</code> function, and will try to resolve the ‘electron’ module. </p><h2 id="A-Story-about-two-requires"><a href="#A-Story-about-two-requires" class="headerlink" title="A Story about two requires"></a>A Story about two <code>require</code>s</h2><p><code>require</code> as been with us for a while, since the first version of Node back in 2008, almost 10 years. But still is one of the most misunderstand functions in modern web development. With the integration of <code>import</code> and <code>export</code> keywords in Node, several articles was written to explain how the <code>require</code> function currently works. TL;DR: A <code>require</code> function is injected for every file, allowing Node to resolve the dependencies. Later, module builders will look for <code>import</code> and <code>require</code> and will try to resolve modules, assuming that’s what you want. </p><p>So, now that we know that <code>require</code> is actually a function injected by Node, then how is <code>require</code> able to work in Electron renderer process. You may guessed it, Electron injects its own version of <code>require</code> function in the global scope of the renderer process when it loads the page. So, although it may seems like the same function, it is not. </p><h2 id="How-to-use-ipcRenderer-in-a-Angular-CLI-application-Or-any-application-bundle-with-Webpack"><a href="#How-to-use-ipcRenderer-in-a-Angular-CLI-application-Or-any-application-bundle-with-Webpack" class="headerlink" title="How to use ipcRenderer in a Angular-CLI application? (Or any application bundle with Webpack)"></a>How to use ipcRenderer in a Angular-CLI application? (Or any application bundle with Webpack)</h2><p>To use <code>ipcRenderer</code> in our Angular-CLI app, we will leverage on the global scope. No, we won’t call ipcRenderer in the global context, although we could make this works, it’s not ideal. But I just told that <code>require</code> is a function that Electron injects in the global context. So, can we just use <code>require</code>? No. That’s because, as I also told, Webpack will try to resolve the module requirement. There is actually another way to access a global variable, that’s with the <code>window</code> object. The <code>window</code> object by default will have all the global variables, including <code>require</code>.</p><p>So we can just use <code>window.require</code> in any part of our application and it would work as expected. In this context, you cannot use <code>window.require</code> to require any module in your Angular-CLI application, but you can load any module that you had set in your Electron application.</p><h2 id="Writing-the-service"><a href="#Writing-the-service" class="headerlink" title="Writing the service"></a>Writing the service</h2><p>For this example we will expose the <code>ipc</code> as an Angular service, and will create it using angular-cli. We follow the guide about <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">services</a></p><figure class="highlight shell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ng generate service ipc -m app</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This will create our service, and update our <code>app.module</code> to include it in the Angular application.</p><p>Then, we write the code. We start by importing the IpcRenderer interface from electron module</p><figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> &#123; IpcRenderer &#125; <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">'electron'</span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>But, we don’t have any Electron module in our Angular project, how will it be resolved? We’ll, actually we don’t need to have the Electron module in our Angular project, because as Typescript resolver work, it will look in <code>node_modules</code> in folders that are children from ours project. If you want to be extra safe, or if for any reason this is not a desire behavior, you could install the <code>@types</code> of electron, and it won’t load the hole package.</p><figure class="highlight shell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npm install @types/electron</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Next, we add a reference property inside the class to save the ipcRenderer function when we load it.</p><figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span> _ipc: IpcRenderer | <span class="literal">undefined</span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>It’s important to typed it as <code>IpcRenderer | undefined</code> for compile the code in strict mode, as we may or may not be able to load the ipcRenderer. We now write the constructor, to assign the <code>_ipc</code> in load time. </p><figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">constructor</span>(<span class="params"></span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="built_in">window</span>.require) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">try</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      <span class="keyword">this</span>._ipc = <span class="built_in">window</span>.require(<span class="string">'electron'</span>).ipcRenderer;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125; <span class="keyword">catch</span> (e) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      <span class="keyword">throw</span> e;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125; <span class="keyword">else</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">console</span>.warn(<span class="string">'Electron\'s IPC was not loaded'</span>);</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>As you can see, we will first check if <code>window</code> object has a <code>require</code> property. With this we will assume we are inside Electron, then we will <code>try</code> to <code>require(&#39;electron&#39;)</code>, if for any reason it doesn’t work it just throw an error, and the property <code>_ipc</code> will be undefined.

    <title>Electron With Typescript Using Ts-Node</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my last post, I talked about how to <a href="/integrating-an-angular-cli-application-with-electron-34mi">Integrate Angular-CLI with Electron</a>. One of the things that was missing was the use of Typescript, oposite to vanilla Javascript, though Electron’s  main is a Node based engine, so almost everything about ES2015 and ES2016 should work, some newer features are still missing as current version, <code>1.7.11</code>, is based on <code>node 7.9</code>. And, types are still missing, because of JavaScript. Using Electron with Typescript, is really simple, but we would need to install some modules.</p><h2 id="Installing-dependencies"><a href="#Installing-dependencies" class="headerlink" title="Installing dependencies"></a>Installing dependencies</h2><p>We move to the Electron entry folder. In the case the you are integrating with Angular-CLI following my guide, it would be <code>electron</code> folder. Then, we run:</p><figure class="highlight shell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npm install -D typescript ts-node</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><ul><li><em>typescript</em>: Well, this is actually what we want to use.</li><li><em>ts-node</em>: TypeScript execution environment and REPL for node. This will resolver all the <code>.ts</code> files on the fly. </li></ul><h2 id="Creating-tsconfig-json"><a href="#Creating-tsconfig-json" class="headerlink" title="Creating tsconfig.json"></a>Creating tsconfig.json</h2><p>Run <code>npx tsc --init</code> if you are using npm 5.2+ to create the <code>tsconfig.json</code>. As is it will work, so we will leave it. </p><h2 id="Updating-files"><a href="#Updating-files" class="headerlink" title="Updating files"></a>Updating files</h2><p>We need to modify how the application runs.</p><ul><li>Create a folder named <code>src</code>, this will be our development folder.</li><li>Move <code>index.js</code> to <code>src</code> and rename it <code>index.ts</code>. This is now a Typescript file.</li><li>Create a new <code>index.js</code> in the application root, with the following content.<figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'ts-node'</span>).register(); <span class="comment">// This will register the TypeScript compiler</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'./src'</span>); <span class="comment">// This will load our Typescript application</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></li></ul><h2 id="Running-Electron"><a href="#Running-Electron" class="headerlink" title="Running Electron"></a>Running Electron</h2><p>Now it’s time to try, and run <code>npm start</code> if you are following the integration guide, or <code>electron .</code> if you don’t have the associated script.</p><p>You should see something like this:<br><img src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/z1g6mt642m943tunr9my.png" alt="electron-error"></p><p>This is fine. Because we are using <code>__dirname</code> as our folder root, now Electron can’t find the app source. </p><h2 id="Updating-index-ts"><a href="#Updating-index-ts" class="headerlink" title="Updating index.ts"></a>Updating <code>index.ts</code></h2><p>Hopefully, the solution is really simple. Just change <code>__dirname</code> in the <code>path.join</code> function with <code>app.getAppPath()</code>. </p><p><em>What getAppPath() is?</em> <a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api/app#appgetapppath" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docs</a><br>This is a Electron function that will resolve to the root of the application path. </p><h2 id="Running-Electron-again"><a href="#Running-Electron-again" class="headerlink" title="Running Electron (again)"></a>Running Electron (again)</h2><p>If everything went fine, you should now see your application running inside Electron.</p><h1 id="Notes"><a href="#Notes" class="headerlink" title="Notes"></a>Notes</h1><p>This is just a guide to show how this <em>work</em>. However, I don’t recommend use <code>ts-node</code> as a production solution. Also, I have not test the <code>getAppPath</code> function in a bundle application, so it may fail. </p><h1 id="Moving-forward"><a href="#Moving-forward" class="headerlink" title="Moving forward"></a>Moving forward</h1><p>We have now a Electron application written in Typescript. It could optimize for production by using a build system, such Webpack. Also, we could target <code>es6</code> in the <code>tsconfig</code> file as Electron main will work fine with es2015. </p><p>Uses of native modules are something that seems to have interest of users, so I’ll probably made a guide about using them.</p><h1 id="Series"><a href="#Series" class="headerlink" title="Series"></a>Series</h1><ul><li><a href="/integrating-an-angular-cli-application-with-electron-34mi">The seed</a></li><li><a href="/electron-with-typescript-using-ts-node-8oi">Electron with Typescript</a></li><li><a href="/integrating-an-angular-cli-application-with-electron---the-ipc-4m18">The IPC</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/625dcb0918e78fdf75030507f8085039/tumblr_n05mepfYgB1tq4of6o1_500.gif" alt="Promise"></p><p>I like to dig around the new features that are coming to JS, even when most of the time we need to transpile them down, you should know that you can, and should, deploy to production <a href="https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using ES2015+ syntax today</a>. In the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current list of proposals in stage-3</a>, was something that catch my attention. That was the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-promise-finally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Promise.prototype.finally</a>.</p><h1 id="FINALLY"><a href="#FINALLY" class="headerlink" title="FINALLY!"></a>FINALLY!</h1><p>So we now have a finally method into Promise. A finally method will be called always, and doesn’t care if the Promise was fulfilled or rejected. It will no alter the value of the resolve promise, but could reject the promise with a new reason. Currently there are several implementations in other future libraries in NPM, as in the current proposal is written. However this, soon to be standard, will allow to use the method in evergreen browsers.</p><h1 id="When-to-use-it"><a href="#When-to-use-it" class="headerlink" title="When to use it"></a>When to use it</h1><p>The finally statement is really common in programming, specially when dealing with external connections that must be closed even in an unsuccessful operation, such as reading external files or database operations. Such connections need to be closed, and doesn’t matter if the operation was successful or not, we just need to close the connection.</p><h1 id="How-to-use-it"><a href="#How-to-use-it" class="headerlink" title="How to use it"></a>How to use it</h1><p>The finally method is really straightforward, every promise will have one, and it will return a promise as well, so you could chain as usual. </p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">Promise</span></span><br><span class="line">    .resolve(<span class="number">3</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    .finally(</span><br><span class="line">        () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'FINALLY!'</span>);</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="number">4</span>;</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    )</span><br><span class="line">    .then(</span><br><span class="line">        value =&gt; <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(value) <span class="comment">// Output: 3</span></span><br><span class="line">    );</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>As you may notice, resolving a value in the finally, have not effects.

I really love them, and they are very handy to work with promises, writing code that looks very clean. This couple makes every function, an asynchronous function, that are resolved as a regular Promise. So, you could just do finally after the declaration of the async function.<br><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> promiseA = <span class="keyword">async</span> () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">await</span> <span class="number">3</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">promiseA.finally(<span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'The promise either was a success or a failure'</span>));</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>The finally method will be called, as per the specification. But, what if we need to <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> inside the async function (That you should). Then, we could use the <code>finally</code> statement.<br><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> aSuperUsefulPromise = <span class="keyword">async</span> () =&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">try</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">await</span> PromiseThatCouldThrow();</span><br><span class="line">  &#125; <span class="keyword">catch</span> (error) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(error);</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// We don't modify the promise here, just catch the error and handle it.</span></span><br><span class="line">  &#125; <span class="keyword">finally</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">await</span> <span class="number">4</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="keyword">await</span> aSuperUsefulPromise()) <span class="comment">// Outputs: 4</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/CDJo4EgHwbaPS/giphy.gif" alt="Wait... What?"><br>Well, when dealing with <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code>/<code>finally</code> you CAN modify the value of a resolved promise. And this is really important to notice and understand, as you may expect a different result. So, you should never return inside a finally statement. It maybe weird to you, cause JS have a implicit return statement, but that return will be called after the finally statement, not before.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The <code>finally</code> method in Promises will be something, but we could accomplish more or less the same behavior using current <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code>/<code>finally</code> statements, we need to be careful though. </p><p>I learn a lot writing this article, and I hope that you could understand a little more about the new <code>finally</code> method.

I currently separate my angular components into 3 categories, based on what their concern is, widgets, to manage the look of them, components, to manage the behavior of them, and as I will introduce to you today, pages, to manage well, pages. </p><h1 id="What-a-page-is"><a href="#What-a-page-is" class="headerlink" title="What a page is?"></a>What a <em>page</em> is?</h1><p>A page is this. What you are looking, what the user will look. Most of the time will be a component that will no be referenced by its <code>selector</code>, but by the router at a certain url. And that its the is first difference between a page component and a regular component.</p><ul><li>A page can contain another pages</li></ul><p>For sure. But, they all should be represented by a url state, nothing more, nothing else. They should never be reference by it’s <code>selector</code>, cause, then I won’t be much of a page, would it?</p><ul><li>A page should not have a <code>selector</code></li></ul><p>If the <code>@Component</code> decorator does not have a <code>selector</code> them is unlikely to reference a page by such. I think is just safer to not do so. </p><ul><li>A page should not have a behavior</li></ul><p>Much as our AppComponent, or wherever you call the entry component of your application, the logic there should be minimum. Most of the AppComponent delegates the behavior to their inner components, the router, and the services.</p><ul><li>A page must have components only</li></ul><p>Well, you have to show something after all. But, why components only? Well, it happens that if you put a widget there, them is more likely to put the logic of that widget inside your page, and it should not be there. </p><ul><li>A page should have end-to-end test</li></ul><p>This is what you user will interact, so I think is logic to put aside this your e2e for that page. If your components should have a unit test beside them, and your widgets should… I think they should have a unit test as well, then your pages should contain nothing more than e2e tests. After all you test all your components. Right? RIGHT? ‘Cause I don’t.</p><h1 id="A-page"><a href="#A-page" class="headerlink" title="A page"></a>A page</h1><p>What would be life without examples to copy-paste? Well, I’m sorry, this is just too useless to be copy-pasted. But still, I hope this idea keeps in you mind. </p><figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> &#123; Component &#125; <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">'@angular/core'</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">@Component</span>(&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  template: <span class="string">`</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">    &lt;my-add-todo&gt;&lt;/my-add-todo&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">    &lt;my-visible-todo-list&gt;&lt;/my-visible-todo-list&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">    &lt;my-filter-buttons-widget&gt;&lt;/my-filter-buttons-widget&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">  `</span>,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">export</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> TodoPage &#123;&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>In this example we can see how a todo page would be.

    <title>Readonly Input for Primitive Properties in Angular&#39;s Widgets</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi! It’s me again. Today I’m releasing the first stable version of my Pomodoro application. I made it using Angular 4, and Electron. While I was developing it, I try to use TDD, use a ngrx/Store, and separate the components of <a href="/widgets-and-components-for-angular-2-and-up">the Widgets</a>, and use <a href="/input-set-pattern-for-widgets-in-angular">the @Input-set, and template-get</a> for manage data. </p><p>But I have to say it, I failed, I failed big time. First at all, I come to realize why TDD is a design pattern, if you don’t have defined what you want to do, you can’t test first. I try to use the Store, but at the end I managed all the state from one component. But I did use Widgets to display the content, where I could. Well, this is actually the first application I do by my self, so, don’t be mean. I’ve been working with AngularJS since 1.2, and with Angular since RC5, but I never had to design the functionality of the app, the business logic was a piece of the company I’d worked on. </p><p>However, where I failed the most was at using the @Input-set/template-get duo. I mean, I could use them, but I most manage primitives values, so why bother? Still, one advantage of this approach is that you could treat the values as inmutables, because you set it somewhere, and return it somewhere else, there is no place to side effects there. </p><p>So how to deal with primitives, without written unnecessary code lines, and still maintaining the immutability? Well, Typescript 2 brought a nice feature to deal with this <code>readonly modifier</code>. You can read more about that <a href="https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/types/readonly.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. It is different from a const, cause the assignment check it’s doing in compilation time, instead of runtime. Meaning, that even if you set your property to <code>readonly</code>, in runtime in can be written as many times as needed. But this approach allows us to be sure that the property will be only written by the inputed value, and we ain’t going to modify it.</p><figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">export</span> <span class="keyword">enum</span> Cicle &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// Cicle values</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">@Component</span>(&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// Component definitions</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">export</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> StartButtonWidget &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="meta">@Input</span>()</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">public</span> readonly cicle: Cicle;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="meta">@Output</span>()</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">public</span> onClick: EventEmitter&lt;Cicle&gt; = <span class="keyword">new</span> EventEmitter&lt;Cicle&gt;();</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">get</span> label(): <span class="built_in">string</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// Returns a strings from the value of the cicle</span></span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">public</span> emit(): <span class="built_in">void</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">this</span>.onClick.emit(<span class="keyword">this</span>.cicle);</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>As you can see, using a readonly property for our input primitives allow us to be sure about how and when it’s the property changing. But, I still think this have a disadvantage. If you need to input a value, and display another value, you could accidentally access the property in a wrong way. And I don’t mean you exactly, but the team you work in. With the <code>@input-set/template-get</code> the intentions you have when you write are clears, but with this, you have to be sure that the primitive is going to be use the way you expect. Documentation would be do it, I think.</p><p>This is just another way to deals with properties in Typescript and Angular framework, I’m sure that you have many ways more, and I would like to read about them in the comments bellow.</p><p>As always, thanks for reading, and I hope you’d liked. </p>]]></content>

I tried to keep it simple for the first implementation, but I’m really turning my head around this. The thing is, React is a JavaScript pure framework and with JSX allow us to do things that we can’t made with plain HTML templates, nevertheless, Typescript allow us for things that JavaScript does not, at the very least, it seems to allow that. Like <em>private</em> properties. With that in mind, I’ll try to explain why you should use private properties inside a Widget and how to manage the data entry in a better way.</p><h2 id="The-situation"><a href="#The-situation" class="headerlink" title="The situation"></a>The situation</h2><p>Following the comparative with React from the last post, when the <code>props</code> are send to a <code>component</code>, most of the the time we are getting it following the destructive pattern, allowing to do things like:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">interface IUser &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  firstname: string;</span><br><span class="line">  lastname: string;</span><br><span class="line">  age: number;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">export function usersList(&#123;users = []&#125;

I know that Typescript is compiled to JavaScript, and JavaScript doesn’t have such things, but, we’ll do as we don’t care.<br>Also, we will use a ES6 <code>set</code> feature.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h2><p>If you are coming from React, the React community as develop some patterns that made easy and simple to develop apps with this framework. One of this patterns is the <em>smart</em> and <em>dumb</em> component, or <em>container</em> and <em>component</em>. This keeps a separation between how a component should display the data, and how a component actually manage the data. If you want more about this, there are plenty of articles about it, this is not what I’m writing about.</p><h2 id="Situation"><a href="#Situation" class="headerlink" title="Situation"></a>Situation</h2><p>The actual name for a piece of web page according to the standard it’s “web component”, so one might think that calling <em>component</em> to the piece of code that shows the data it’s the most accurate way to name them. But…</p><p><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/1l5mqr.jpg" alt="I reject nature"></p><p>Angular community had develop their own way of thinking about what a component is, and in the Angular community I had see so many times that a <em>component</em> have a <em>behavior</em>. </p><blockquote><p>What?! This is just insane. A component should concern only about how to display the data, no how to manage it.</p></blockquote><p>Well, it is true. The only fact that Angular components are called <em>Components</em> it’s one of the examples to show my point of view. Still, we need some way to manage the display of the data. </p><h2 id="Solution-proposal"><a href="#Solution-proposal" class="headerlink" title="Solution proposal"></a>Solution proposal</h2><p>I know this would be only another solution proposal, and mine doesn’t actually adds anything to current implementation, it’s just syntactic sugar for the same thing.</p><h3 id="Introducing-Widgets"><a href="#Introducing-Widgets" class="headerlink" title="Introducing Widgets"></a>Introducing Widgets</h3><p>So… Widgets? What <em>should</em> they be? I propose <em>Widgets</em> to name anything that only should concern about how to display something. And this it’s something that Angular it’s great at, separation. I’m not saying that React it’s bad about it, but I think that the Angular team had a better approach to this issue.</p><p>Ideally a Widget should have only <code>@input</code>s and <code>@output</code>s. That’s all. A Widget had to be made to show info, and it have to be a component that reflects that in their code. There should be no logic inside a Widget, but the logic that a Widget need to show the data that is being inputed. </p><p>I also think about the way that the data should be managed inside the Widget, but that would be for another day (Or you can read this <a href="https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer/issues/222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue</a>)</p><h3 id="What-widgets-should-be"><a href="#What-widgets-should-be" class="headerlink" title="What widgets should be"></a>What widgets should be</h3><ul><li>Widgets should be the presentation components of and Angular application.</li><li>Widgets should be logicless.</li><li>Widgets should be concern about the style of their own data.</li></ul><h2 id="Questions"><a href="#Questions" class="headerlink" title="Questions"></a>Questions</h2><h5 id="Widgets-are-just-components"><a href="#Widgets-are-just-components" class="headerlink" title="Widgets are just components?"></a>Widgets are just <em>components</em>?</h5><p>Yes. :).

I’ll try to explain the code.</p><figure class="highlight ts"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> &#123; Component, Input &#125; <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">'@angular/core'</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> &#123; ITodoItem &#125; <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">'./../../models'</span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>First of all, imports. From <code>@angular/core</code> we import <code>input</code> and <code>component</code> decorators. Remember, everything in Angular it’s a decorator, so are Widgets, that name it’s just sugar. There is not a <code>Widget</code> decorator, and I don’t think that it should be one. From a model folder, the import of the <code>Item</code> model. </p><figure class="highlight ts"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">@Component</span>(&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  selector: <span class="string">'my-todo-list-widget'</span>,</span><br><span class="line">  template: <span class="string">`</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">  &lt;ul&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">    &lt;my-todo *ngFor="let todo of todoList;trackBy:todo?.id"</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">      [todo]="todo"</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">    &gt;&lt;/my-todo&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">  &lt;/ul&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">  `</span>,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>So we decorate. I use the suffix <code>widget</code> for the selector, cause I had a component with the same name. So if you can name things better than I do, you should not need that. Also, the template, the less, the better. I think that if your template it’s less than 10 lines, you should inline it. But, it’s up to you. What is important it’s to define all the display behavior here.</p><figure class="highlight ts"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">export</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> TodoListWidget &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="meta">@Input</span>() <span class="keyword">public</span> todoList: ITodoItem[];</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Finally, we declare the class. This is the important part. As you can see, there is not logic here. It’s just a class requesting an <code>input</code> property and nothing else. </p><h4 id="More-examples"><a href="#More-examples" class="headerlink" title="More examples"></a>More examples</h4><p>If you want a couple of more examples about Widgets, checkout my repo <a href="https://github.com/michaeljota/angular2-ultimate-starter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">angular2-ultimate-starter</a>. This is based of <code>AngularClass</code> starter, but I added <code>ngrx/store</code> implementation, and a couple patters borrow from React, as <code>Widgets</code>.</p><h2 id="Thanks-you"><a href="#Thanks-you" class="headerlink" title="Thanks you"></a>Thanks you</h2><p>This is all for now. This is my first post, like ever, about Angular. I hope you enjoy this, and for anything you have to say about this, I’m looking forward to read your comments. Cheers and happy coding!</p>]]></content>
